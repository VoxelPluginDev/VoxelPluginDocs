# Finding the Right Nodes

When working with MetaGraphs, it is easy to be unsure what nodes to use.&#x20;

When this happens, use whatever input and output pins you have in your graph by dragging from them into the graph and letting go. This will open a search menu, which will only show compatible nodes, making it easier to find what you're looking for.&#x20;

At the top of the search menu, you fill find a few recommendations for nodes which are specifically designed to work with the type you're dragging out from. These will often be the nodes which are key building blocks for creating a functional graph.

This strategy will, for instance, make it easy to determine that the `Generate Marching Cube Surface` nodes take a `Create Spawner` node output as their first input.
