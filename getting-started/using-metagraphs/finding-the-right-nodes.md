# Finding the Right Nodes

When working with MetaGraphs, it is common for new users to not know what nodes to use.&#x20;

When this happens, use whatever input and output pins you have in your graph by dragging from them into the graph and letting go. This will open a search menu, which will only show compatible nodes, making it easier to find what you're looking for.&#x20;

This strategy will, for instance, let you easily find out that the `Create X from Marching Cube Surface` nodes take a `Generate Surface as Marching Cube Surface` node output as their primary input.
