# Using the MetaGraph Preview

When a graph is created and first opened, there are no nodes and the preview is therefore inactive. Once you do have nodes, you can right-click any pin and click "Preview this node". When you do, you will see the preview window in the top-left of your graph update to show what you selected.&#x20;
