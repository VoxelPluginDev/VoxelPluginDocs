# Layers & Priority

Layers are defined in the Voxel Plugin section of the Project Settings. Like stamps, they are of either a Height or Volume type. Stamps can only write into layers of the same type.

The layer at the top of a stack is applied first, with any stamps in the layer below it being blended on top of the first layer.&#x20;
