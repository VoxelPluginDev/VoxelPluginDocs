# Instanced Stamps

Instanced stamps are a way to have a large amount of stamps in your world without the extra performance cost associated with having lots of actors or components.&#x20;

Instanced stamp components are automatically used when stamps are spawned using the `Voxel Stamp Spawner` node in PCG.
