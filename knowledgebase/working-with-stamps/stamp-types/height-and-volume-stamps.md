# Height & Volume Stamps

Stamps can work with data in one of two domains.

Height - most similar to working with traditional landscapes:

* Data is handled as a top-down view of the world
  * One value for every XY position in the world
* The shape of the terrain is represented by a straight-forward 'height' value.

Or Volume - allowing for overhangs and caves:

* Data is fully volumetric
  * Every XYZ position in the world has its own values
* The shape of the terrain is represented by a 'distance' value, &#x20;
