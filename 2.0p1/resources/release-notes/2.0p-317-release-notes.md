## 2.0p-317

[https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/tree/2.0p-317](https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/tree/2.0p-317) - Released April 26 2023

* Add 5.2 compatibility
* Remove 5.0 compatibility
* Add downloadable example content
  * You can right click the content browser -> Add voxel content
* Add brush/channel system
  * [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
* Add back voxel invokers
  * [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
* Add graph-based foliage
  * Existing foliage clusters & instance assets will be invalidated
  * Foliage collision is not yet supported
  * [foliage.md](../../knowledgebase-1/foliage.md "mention")
* Add graph search
  * You can right click any parameter or any node to see where it's used
  * You can also search through all assets by clicking the global search button top right of the search tab
* Add back density canvases
  * [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
* Add blueprint getter/setters for graph parameters
  * [setting-graph-parameters.md](../../knowledgebase-1/blueprints/setting-graph-parameters.md "mention")
* Allow querying Voxel Graphs from blueprints
  * Limited to floats for now
  * [querying-voxel-graphs.md](../../knowledgebase-1/blueprints/querying-voxel-graphs.md "mention")
* Add UFUNCTION nodes
  * Example here: [https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/blob/2.0p/Source/VoxelGraphNodes/Public/VoxelBasicFunctionLibrary.h](https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/blob/2.0p/Source/VoxelGraphNodes/Public/VoxelBasicFunctionLibrary.h)
* Remove exec flow from graph
* Remove GPU compute from graphs
  * The current approach was too messy & unusable
  * C++: this removes all buffer views, you can use buffers directly now
* Add smart graph diffing: only values affected by the graph changes are updated
* Add inline macros to graphs
  * You can create graph macros using the graph left panel
* Remove custom content mapping
  * /VoxelPlugin is now /Voxel, existing content references will be broken
* Start adding new material layer pipeline
  * This is not ready yet, assets will be broken by the next release
* Fix transition meshes
* Remove render thread throttle. All updates should feel snappier now, but you might see some frame dips. You can add the throttle back using `voxel.threading.MaxConcurrentRenderTasks 4`
* Voxel Meta Actors cannot be moved anymore
  * This means setups such as rotating planets are currently not possible
  * This will be fixed in a later release with the introduction of Voxel Domains
  * If your voxel actor was not at origin, your entire world will be shifted with this update!
* Mac is fully supported (tested on an M1 Mac Mini)
