{% hint style="info" %}
This release is targeted at Unreal Engine 5.5. It should largely work on 5.4, but full support for 5.4 is not guaranteed.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Voxel Plugin 2.0 is actively being developed and can be buggy at times. The latest release of Voxel Plugin 2.0 can be downloaded through the [Voxel Plugin Installer ](getting-started/installing-voxel-plugin.md) (recommended) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/) (advanced).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

We’re working hard to make sure this documentation contains as much information as possible. We’re a small team, and the plugin is growing fast. New features and changes may not yet be shown in the documentation.

This documentation is mostly intended to cover technical considerations. In order to get started working with the plugin's systems, we recommend [exploring the voxel content](getting-started/installing-voxel-content.md).&#x20;

Note that there is not currently any Blueprint or C++ API documentation.
