**Note:** Voxel Plugin 2.0 is actively being developed and can be buggy at times. The latest release of Voxel Plugin 2.0 can be downloaded through the [Plugin Downloader](getting-started/installing-voxel-plugin.md) (recommended) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/) (advanced).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

We’re working hard to make sure this documentation contains as much information as possible. We’re a small team, and the plugin is growing fast, so new features and changes may not be completely reflected in the documentation.

This documentation is primarily intended to cover technical considerations. In order to get started working with the plugin's systems, we recommend [exploring the voxel content](getting-started/installing-voxel-content.md).&#x20;

Note that there is not currently any Blueprint or C++ API documentation.
