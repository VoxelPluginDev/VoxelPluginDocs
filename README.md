## Installing Voxel Plugin

In this guide, we will be going through the process of how to install Voxel Plugin to an existing project.

### 1. Downloading Voxel Plugin from the Unreal Engine Marketplace

To start off, open the Epic Games Launcher. In the Unreal Engine section, navigate to the Marketplace and use the search-bar in the top-right to search for “Plugin Downloader”. Find the “Plugin Downloader” result, with “Voxel Plugin” as creator, and click it.

With the store page open, click the “Free” button to get access to the plugin. You will be prompted to log in if you aren’t already, and then to accept the Epic Content License Agreement. After doing this, the "Free" button will have changed to an "Install to Engine" button. Press that, select the engine version you are working in the slot dropdown and press "Install".

The plugin will now download and install. Once this has finished, start the project you want to use Voxel Plugin in. In this project, go to "Edit -> Plugins" to open the Plugin browser.

With the plugin window open, use the search bar to look for "Plugin Downloader". If it does not appear, try restarting the engine and looking again.

Tick the checkbox to the left of the Plugin Downloader icon, and press the "Restart Now" button in the bottom right.

After restarting, a Voxel Plugin icon will have appeared on the right-hand side of your editor's toolbar, next to the "Settings" dropdown.&#x20;

Click the Voxel Plugin icon and a dropdown menu will appear. In this menu, click the "Login" button. This will open a login page for your Epic account in your browser. Log into your Epic account, and click "Allow" when asked to let Voxel Plugin use your Epic Games account.
