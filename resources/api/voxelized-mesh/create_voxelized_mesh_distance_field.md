# Create Voxelized Mesh Distance Field

<div align="left" data-full-width="false"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/create_voxelized_mesh_distance_field.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Creates a distance field from a voxelized static mesh @param bHermiteInterpolation Enabling hermite interpolation can lead to higher quality results (less artifacts when interpolating), but is up to 4x more expensive
