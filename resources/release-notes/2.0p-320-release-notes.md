# 2.0p-320 Release Notes

## 2.0p-320.2

[https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/tree/2.0p-320.2 ](https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/tree/2.0p-320.2)- Released June 9 2023

**New features:**

* Foliage Settings can now be set on the Spawn Foliage node
  * This can be used to set AffectDistanceField, which is false by default
* Foliage Collision is in & can be configured on the Spawn Foliage node&#x20;

**Migration notes:**

* Foliage collision is now enabled by default. Pass a body instance with collision disabled to Spawn Foliage to disable it

#### Bug fixes:

* Fix VOXEL\_DEBUG=1 on clang
* Fix stack overflow when too many brushes are overlapping
* Fix dedicated server crash (`FSlateApplication::Get`)
* Fix crash when making a level instance with a voxel actor in it
* Fix bug with bool when using clang
  * When optimizations are enabled, clang expects a bool to be 0 or 1
  * ISPC doesn't follow such rules, and thus invalid code gen was occurring
* Add `-voxelCheckNaNs` and `voxel.CheckNaNs 1` to check for NaNs

## 2.0p-320.1

[https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/tree/2.0p-320.1](https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/tree/2.0p-320.1) - Released May 22 2023

#### Release notes:

* Add a Migrate to Voxel Scene context menu option to Voxel Meta Graphs
* Fix setting object parameters in C++
* Add back macro graphs

## 2.0p-320

[https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/tree/2.0p-320.0](https://github.com/VoxelPlugin/VoxelPlugin/tree/2.0p-320.0) - Released May 18 2023

#### Migration notes:

* VoxelMetaGraphs are gone. You will have to make a new VoxelScene and copy the graphs over
* Foliage & Brush Instances are their own asset types now. Existing instances will have their parameter reset - you will need to make new assets
* C++: buffers are now using `FVoxelBufferStorage` instead of array. To make a float buffer, use `FVoxelFloatBufferStorage` instead of `TVoxelArray<float>`
* C++: `AVoxelMetaActor` is renamed to `AVoxelSceneActor`&#x20;

#### Release notes:

* Add GetDistanceToCubemapPlanet: checkout the new Mars example!
  * [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
* Split buffer storage in chunks & add custom allocator
  * Much better performance when using BinnedMalloc2 (ie, packaged dev or shipping)
  * Packaged games should generate 2x as fast
* Disable foliage distance fields
  * This causes huge hitches when generating foliage
  * Foliage should be a lot faster now
  * Will be exposed as a setting in a future release
* Switch pin values to store object as hard references instead of soft references
  * This should fix loading & GC issues we've been seeing
* Add IsGameWorld/IsEditorWorld nodes
* Fix standalone
* Fix VR shaders
* Add CreatePreviewInGame to brush actors, letting you use their preview meshes in game
* Fix node interaction after placing a comment
* Add custom blueprint node QueryVoxelChannel to query any value type
* Add MaxLOD to screen size chunk spawner
* Fix GetGradient costing too much
* Meta Graphs are renamed to Voxel Scenes, you'll have to manually copy them over
* AVoxelMetaActor is renamed to AVoxelSceneActor
* VoxelFoliage is renamed to VoxelSpawner
* Existing brush & foliage instance parameters (ie, assets with a Parent being set) will be invalidated
* Enable Distance Checks is gone: increase the Distance Checks tolerance to achieve the same effect
* Update includes to follow the new 5.2 includes: this significantly improves build times & should speed up any file including a voxel file
* Add Perfect Transitions option to marching cube node: this will query each LOD separately, which can help reduce holes if the distance is different for 2 LODs
* Add blueprint-like advanced display to voxel nodes
* Default to screen size chunk spawner when no chunk spawner is plugged
